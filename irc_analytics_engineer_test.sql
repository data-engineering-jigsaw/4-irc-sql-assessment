/*
IRC Analytics Engineering SQL Test

This test consists of two parts:

1. A SQL skill-based component consisting of a series of questions on provided
datasets, whereby there are - more or less - right and wrong answers.


Please spend no more than three hours on the test. Part One should only
require about 45-60 minutes, while you should expect to spend about 1-2 hours
on Part Two.

/*
-- Part One: --
Using the provided datasets (accounts.csv and donations.csv), answer the
following questions with a SQL statement that will produce the correct results.
Please write your SQL in this document below. You may also include screenshots
of results if you wish. However, you will be graded on your SQL code, not your
results. The IRC uses T-SQL. However, you may use any SQL dialect that you are
comfortable with.

*Please note here which SQL dialect you are using:*

Notes on the datasets:
- The primary key of accounts is account_id.
- The primary key of donations is donation_id.
